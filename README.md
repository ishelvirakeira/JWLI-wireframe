This project involved building a static wireframe website for the Japanese Women’s Leadership Institute (JWLI). The goal was to recreate the layout, structure, and overall design of a professional nonprofit organization’s website without using JavaScript or frameworks. It focused on understanding how to organize large amounts of content, design multi-section pages, and make the layout responsive on mobile devices.

I used HTML and CSS tools.

I learned how to organize large content sections like History, Partners, and Newsletter. I also practiced controlling layout with floats, margins, and padding before relying on modern frameworks. I improved understanding of adapting widths, removing floats, and adjusting text for smaller screens.
